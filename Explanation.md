# Explanation: Visibility Timeout and Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)

In an event-driven architecture using Amazon SQS and AWS Lambda, **visibility timeout** and **Dead-Letter Queues (DLQs)** are essential mechanisms for ensuring reliable and fault-tolerant message processing.

## 1. Visibility Timeout

When a Lambda function starts processing a message from the SQS queue, that message becomes invisible to other consumers for a set duration known as the **visibility timeout**. This ensures that no other instance of the Lambda function can process the same message simultaneously, preventing **duplicate processing**.

If the Lambda function **successfully finishes** within the timeout, the message is deleted from the queue. However, if it fails (due to an exception or timeout), the message becomes visible again after the timeout period, allowing it to be **retried automatically**.

This is especially useful in scenarios where processing might intermittently fail due to temporary issues (e.g., network errors or DynamoDB throttling). By using visibility timeout correctly, the system can automatically **retry messages without human intervention**.

## 2. Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)

To prevent problematic messages from being retried infinitely and potentially clogging the main queue, a **Dead-Letter Queue** is configured. In our setup, if a message fails to be successfully processed **three times** (as set by `maxReceiveCount = 3`), it is moved to the DLQ.

This is incredibly useful for:
- Isolating and analyzing **invalid or malformed messages**
- Preventing **Lambda cold-start storms** caused by repeated failures
- Maintaining system **resilience and throughput**

DLQs provide a **safe fallback** mechanism where failures can be **debugged and resolved later** without disrupting the overall order processing pipeline.

Together, visibility timeout and DLQs form the **backbone of fault handling and reliability** in serverless and event-driven systems.
